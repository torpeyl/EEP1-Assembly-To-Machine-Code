# EEP1-Assembly-To-Machine-Code
Convert Assembly code to machine code for the EEP1 cpu

Although the code below is written in upper case, the compiler is not case-sensitive. 
This compiler will accept values written in any of the following formats, however negative numbers should be avoided if possible as their behaviour may be undefined by EEP1:
  
• 0x01            &nbsp;  &nbsp; (hex)  
• -0x01           &nbsp;  &nbsp; (hex)  
• #-0x01          &nbsp;  &nbsp; (hex)  
• #0x01           &nbsp;  &nbsp; (hex)  
• #-1              &nbsp; &nbsp; (decimal)  
• #1              &nbsp; &nbsp; (decimal)  
• 1               &nbsp; &nbsp; (decimal)  
• -1             &nbsp; &nbsp; (decimal)  
• 0b1            &nbsp; &nbsp; (binary)  
• #0b01          &nbsp; &nbsp; (binary)  
• #-0b01         &nbsp; &nbsp; (binary)  
• -0b1           &nbsp; &nbsp; (binary)
